# Subway-Time
Subway-Time is a New York City MTA Schedule - UCF Bootcamp Week 7 Homework

## Requirements 
In this assignment, I created a train schedule application for the 59th Street & Columbus Circle Subway station. It incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js.  It provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
